    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings! My name is Ryle Alejandro Silva. I am 19 years old, and I live in Tikiw, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija. I am currently studying in College Of The Immaculate Conception as an IT student, with a major in Animation.</p> <br />
    <p>Here are a few of things I like to do:</p>
    <p>.Using cellphone for personal use</p> 
    <p>.Learning how to animate and draw</p>
    <p>.Watching TV shows, movies, anime, etc.</p>
    <p>.Learning how to code (Sometimes)</p>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>When it comes to how I act, I am usually not the talk-first person because I am quite an introvert 
      and don't have much talking material to other people, but I try to be part of conversation if I understand something.</p> <br />
    <p>I tend to be a good person, usually by doing small good things, such as giving other people things they need, 
      and trying to coordinate with other people in what we're doing together right now.</p>
